*****************

//this is written in javascript
var MyClass = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    return (
      <div>hello world</div>
    );
  } 
});

//or by writing in ES6 such as this one:
class MyClass extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>hello world</div>;
  }
}

react dom.render vs react dom

React is the library for creating views. ReactDOM is the library used to actually render the UI in the browser.

//map, reduce, and assign.

/////////////////
to create react app:
basic folder set up needed:
public > source

create source folder where which contains all javascript modules

index.html outside of source folder

package.json file

then a build tool

instead of typing React.Component just use an import from the module


to comment out in react app:
{/* or can be written as  */}
